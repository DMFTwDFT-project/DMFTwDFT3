ksum is the module for achieving DMFT self-consistency.


More detail is written in the following paper (Appendix B)

https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.235103

So it performs the k-point sum and compute local Green's function and hybridization function Delta.inp

atomd is the module to compute local atomic interactions used for ctqmc run.

This part is actually written by Kristjan Haule (Rutgers) and so ctqmc code is written by him.

So atomd.py will generate input files for ctqmc run.
