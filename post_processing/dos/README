###### Computing DOS ##########

1) First, copy the following files to the DOS directory.
wannier90.chk, wannier90.eig, INPUT.py, POSCAR, dmft_ksum_dos, DMFT_mu.out, SigMdc.out, (SigMdc_dn.out), 

2) Copy the obtained Sig.out on the real axis to the current directory as SigX.out 

Ex) cp ../ancont/Sig.out ./Sig1.out

3) Run ./Interp_Sig.py to generate SigMoo_real.out file in a more dense mesh.

4) Copy ksum.input file to the current directory.

Ex) cp ../ksum.input ./

5) Now one can change the paramters for ksum in ksum.input. The first line is the number of k-points(usually you need dense k-points), and the second line is the number of omega points. (This number should be same as the number in SigMoo_real.out, also determined in Interp_Sig.py (paramater rom)).

6) Now run dmft_ksum_dos to generate Gloc.out files

Ex) mpirun -n 16 ./dmft_ksum_dos
