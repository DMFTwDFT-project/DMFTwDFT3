Computing Bands and DOS using DMFT self energies
-------------------------------------------------


In this directory, you have src_files, ancont, bands, dos subdirectories.

src_files have the fortran source files to perform DMFT ksum or Green function calculation.

You can compile this and obtain dmft_ksum_dos, dmft_ksum_band

And then you need to analytically continue your self-energy (Sig.out.XXX) on the imaginary axis obtained using CTQMC  to the real axis.
This information is on ancont folder.

You can read the README file in the example folder. (Let me know if this doesn't work)

Once you get the real frequency self energy files, you can now compute band structure and dos.
